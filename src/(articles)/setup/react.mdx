This is an how I like to setup my react project. I generally like to use [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
its faster and than create-react-app and has a much cleaner setup.

If you are a bit lazy like me, download my [script](https://github.com/Arghyahub/SCRIPTS/tree/main/react) and execute it.

Or

Execute the following code :

```sh
wget -O react.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arghyahub/SCRIPTS/main/react/react.sh
chmod +x react.sh
./react.sh
```

# Continue with setup

Execute the following commands

```sh title="To create vite app and current folder"
npm create vite@latest .
```

Once you setup your react project you'll find some files, that you might not need. I generally clean them up

```planetext
|-public
|   |-vite.svg // not req
|
|-src
|   |-assets // not req
```

Run this code to remove them

```sh
rm public/vite.svg
rm -r src/assets
```

The css files such as Index.css and App.css will have some default styles. We don't require that

```sh
echo > src/App.css
echo > src/index.css
```

Finally clean App.tsx or App.jsx files with some `tsrafce` or `rafce`

```js title="Paste this into your App.jsx or App.tsx"
import "./App.css";

const App = () => {
  return <div>App</div>;
};

export default App;
```

Don't forget the edit the favicon in html file

And we are done with a clean setup âœ¨.

# Typescript settings

The setup is done
