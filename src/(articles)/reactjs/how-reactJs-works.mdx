Lets start with knowing ReactJs first

## About ReactJs

React is a javascript framework developed by Facebook for building user interfaces.
Its very simple, allows writing reusable components, works with virtual DOM, and is very fast.

React revolutionized the way we build user interfaces and is now the most popular front-end library in the world.

# Components

React uses virtual DOM to update the view efficiently.
It creates a virtual DOM in memory and compares it with the actual DOM to update only the changed parts.
Its easier and faster to manipulate javascript objects than the actual DOM.

React uses a component based architecture and the components are written in JSX or
Javascript XML a syntax extension of javascript.

it looks like this

```jsx {3-6}
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>How are you</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This is a functional component in React. A function can only return a single value in javascript,
A return statement cannot return multiple values. Thus we wrap all the elements in a single div.

This is how the object notation of the above code looks like

```js
const appElement = {
  type: "div", // describes type of element
  ref: null, // reference to the actual DOM node
  key: null, // unique key for the element
  $$typeof: Symbol.for("react.element"), // important security feature
  props: {
    children: [
      {
        type: "h1",
        ref: null,
        key: null,
        props: {
          children: "Hello World",
        },
      },
      {
        type: "p",
        ref: null,
        key: null,
        props: {
          children: "How are you",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

Everything is self explanatory the key, the type, the ref but the `"$$typeof"` is a special property
used internally by React to identify objects as React elements.
This property helps React distinguish between its own elements and other objects that may be used in JavaScript applications.

And `Symbol` is a javascript primitive data type and is used to create unique values.

It \* uniquely identifies the object and is also used to prevent cross-site scripting attacks by ensuring only objects
created through React.createElement or JSX are processed as React element.

This mechanism prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary objects into the React component tree that could be interpreted as executable code or scripts.

# Virtual DOM

DOM or Document Object Model is a tree-like structure that represents the HTML document.
React uses a virtual DOM to update the view efficiently.
It creates a virtual DOM in memory and compares it with the actual DOM to update only the changed parts.
Its faster to edit virtual DOM than changing the UI of actual DOM directly.

The DOM is in the form of a tree structure and each element is a node in the tree.
Editing the real DOM is slow because it causes a lot of performance issue.

That is why React uses a virtual DOM to update the view efficiently. The virtual DOM is in the form of the real DOM
but in object notation and it is very easy to manipulate objects.

<Image src={reactDom} />
React compares the virtual DOM and only the final change is updated to the actual
DOM this process of building the virtual DOM and comparing what part of the tree
needs to be replaced is called `Reconciliation`.

Just imagine you are editing the DOM on a loop, how much performance issue will it cause
if we had to update the actual DOM on every change. React solves the problem by executing the operations on the virtual
DOM and the final change is passed to the actual DOM.

# Reconciliation

The process of comparing virtual DOM and updating the actual DOM is called reconciliation.

#### Diffing algorithm

Diffing algorithm is the heart of the reconciliation process.
It operates on two trees (the new virtual DOM tree and the old virtual DOM tree) and tries to
find the minimum number of operations required to transform the old tree into the new tree.

#### Updating the DOM

Say you changed the layout from

<div className="flex flex-row w-full">
```jsx
// A
<ul>
    <li>One</li>
    <li>Two</li>
</ul>
```

```jsx
// B
<ul>
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
</ul>
```

</div>
