# My Personal Website
### Using **HTML CSS Javascript** 

<br>
I'm not very proficient in Javascript or developing beautiful websites, I'm trying my best. The CSS is a bit clumsy sorryðŸ˜…

> Feel free to use my website, I would like to see it become better

Things I'm using

- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [x] JAVASCRIPT

> Quick Tip
> * Stop looking for the best resource, It Simply doesn't exists. If any complete resource does exist the amount of data is big enough to mess up your mind
> * You will always find something outside of your knowledge, it's good to have a learning attitude but learning some things simply doesn't makes sense. Search about the importance of the topic. ``` I have learned some topics which are old and ambiguous and doesn't makes sense, it would have been better if I would've skipped them and move to advanced topic ```
> * It's okay to Google things up, It's not an exam or interview where you have to remember every single piece of information and develop everything from scratch. Development should be interesting and fruitful, where you have an end result or product that you are proud of.
